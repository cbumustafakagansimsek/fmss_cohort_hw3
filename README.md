## Project Content
We're going to make a weather API. **https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api** is used as an api from this application.

Our main goal is to write an API to communicate with these APIs. Let's show the daily, weekly and monthly weather report according to the country / city information that we will get from the user.

The request will first come to the API you will write, then after you receive the request, you will request the Free Weather APIs and return this information.

You can use the very easy to use RestTemplate class for this process.
